<h1>Beers and Books</h1>

<bold>An app that pair beers with  books and books with beer using third party apis.</bold>
<br/>

<h2>The Requirements</h2>
<br/>
MVP - minimum viable product
<br/>
A working full-stack application, built in a team
Use the MEAN stack : Mongo, Express, Angular, Node
The app should consume an API (self made, a third party, or both)
A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to the hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. Commit early, commit often
At least one Github commit per day per member
A daily tracker that all group members use (Trello, github issues, or another similar tracker), that can be reviewed by the instructional team
Be deployed online and accessible to the public via Heroku
Have a link to the hosted working app in the README.md file in the github repo
<br/>

<h2>The Idea</h2>
<br/>
On the Friday that this project was introduced our group, Amanda Capella, Joe Ciampi and Emily Cali, broke for lunch to theorize what could be done for this assignment. Amanda thought that a beer app would be interesting and Emily thought some kind of reading list could be made. Both these ideas pointed to third party apis. Joe Amanda and Emily all agreed to see what they could do having users create beer and book pairings.
<br/>
The original plan consisted of a query to an api also triggering the query to the other. This many to many relationship was not easy to digest and theorize so it was dropped in favor of the ability for users to instead pick a beer that they like or want to drink and then a book that they want to read or are reading and having those interact with each other and the user.
<br/>

<h2>The Process</h2>
<br/>
Visit the <a href="https://trello.com/b/u98Uxw2X">Trello</a>, you may need to be logged in and add yourself to view this board.
<br/>
This project was started with a repo created by Jow Ciampi, all three members then cloned the repo to their computers and created branches as needed to develop different portions of the code.
<br/>
Amanda began with the user model and sessions, she created this functionality with multiple npms and validators as well as authentication and encrypting with both json web tokens and bycrypt.
<br/>
Joe set out to find the appropriate third party beer api and implement it to get information and use that information to make a collection of beers.
<br/>
Emily searched for a book api to pull data from and complete the same functionality as Joe.
<br/>
The group planned to come together with their controllers and information and complete a many to many relationship that would not only show that the user selected certain beers and books but that the beers and books were indeed paired for that user.
<br/>
To mitigate this problem the team reorganized and turned their three controllers into one. Combining their code allowed them to call their data much more easily and set the pairing up simply.

<h2>The Hiccups</h2>
<br/>
Amanda please explain the struggles you had in third person
<br/>
Joe please explain the struggles you had in third person

Emily's struggle in third person

<h2>Styling Decisions</h2>
<br/>
PROBABLY SHOULD ACTUALLY DRAW WIRE FRAMES, WE SPOKE TO EACH OTHER PRETTY WELL ABOUT IT BUT DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE IMAGES TO BACK UP OUR IDEAS
I can do this in the morning and load them up/ talk about them with you all before we load them
=========================================================================
<h2>Functionality</h2>
HOW OUR APP BEHAVES WHAT CRUD ROUTES DOES IT DO DOES IT USE ALL OF MEAN STACK WHAT NPMS DID WE DO AND WHY WHY ARE OUR MODELS THE WAY THEY ARE etc
API DOCUMENTATION LINKS MAYBE
=========================================================================


<h2>Special Thanks</h2>
we an thank the class and maybe link to extra notes and stack overflow documents that helped us

<h2>Meet the Team</h2>
WHO WE ARE AND WHY WE KICK BUTT
